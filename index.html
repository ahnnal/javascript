            <h1>JavaScript</h1>
            <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
            <p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.</p>
            <p>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.</p>
            <p>Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>

            <h2>Java vs JavaScript</h2>
            <p>It can be argued that JavaScript was named JavaScript because it had a lot in common. However, that much in common is the commonality of programming languages that exist between different programming languages, such as those between C and Java. JavaScript is a language that borrows various concepts from one language to another rather than a specific language.</p>
            <p>JavaScript borrowed Java's grammar and "raw value vs. object relationship.", borrowed a function that is a top-level object of schema and oak, borrowed prototype inheritance from Self, and strings, arrays, and regular expressions from Pearl and Python.</p>
